#Face Recognition Attendance System  
An intelligent and secure face recognition-based attendance system using Python, OpenCV, face_recognition, SQLite, and optional SMS integration via Twilio or Fast2SMS. Ideal for classrooms, offices, and controlled-entry systems. This project includes features such as an admin panel with password protection, real-time face recognition using a webcam, auto-attendance marking for both entry and exit modes, duplicate prevention logic, and SMS notifications via Twilio or Fast2SMS. Users can export attendance logs as CSV files, view and manage registered students, and check real-time student status. The project automatically initializes the SQLite database and webcam, storing facial encodings for future recognition. The main components are `sam.py` (the main application), `attendance_system.db` (SQLite database), and a `requirements.txt` file for dependencies. To use it, install Python 3.7 or above, ensure a webcam is connected, and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies. After cloning the repository, update the SMS credentials in the code. Uncomment and fill in your Twilio or Fast2SMS credentials: for Twilio, set `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`; for Fast2SMS, set `FAST2SMS_API_KEY`. Do not commit sensitive credentials to GitHub—use environment variables in production. Run the system using `python sam.py`. Admin login credentials are `admin` / `admin123`, which you can change in the source code. System controls include pressing 'e' to switch between entry/exit modes, 'a' for admin login, and 'q' to quit. Optional SMS alerts can be configured via Twilio (global) or Fast2SMS (India). When a student is marked for entry or exit, an SMS notification is sent to their registered number. Face recognition uses the `hog` model with a 10-second cooldown to prevent repeat marking. You can export attendance data via the admin panel as `attendance_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`. Limitations include single-face recognition per student, lighting dependency, and hardcoded credentials (should be improved for production).
